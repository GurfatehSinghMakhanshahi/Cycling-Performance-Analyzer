It is an analysis of how rider specialization and stage type influence performance in professional cycling using data from a simulated multi-stage environment. Rider classifications (All-Rounder, Sprinter, Climber, Unclassed) and stage types (Flat, Hills, Mountain) were modeled through a Mixed-Effects Linear Model to capture both fixed effects of rider and terrain, and random effects reflecting individual variability. Results show that All-Rounders perform consistently across terrains, Sprinters dominate flat stages but decline on harder ones, and Climbers excel in mountains. The findings highlight that performance is strongly context-dependent and that mixed-effects modeling provides an effective framework for understanding and predicting cycling outcomes.
